# Facespace-Backend

This is the repository for the Module 18 Challenge which was to make the back-end of a social network app.
The application utilizes Mongoose to connect to the Mongo database and has timestamp functionality.
You can get all users, all thoughts, and create new users. I am currently still working on debugging as other functions are not available.
